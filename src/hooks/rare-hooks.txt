useInsertionEffect Hook : 
    The useInsertionEffect hook is a React hook that is used for injecting styles into the DOM before any other DOM mutations occur. 
    This makes it particularly useful for CSS-in-JS libraries or any scenario where you need to ensure that styles are applied before the browser paints the screen.

useId Hook : 
    Generates a unique ID for use in components.
    Useful for accessibility and associating elements.
    Ensures IDs are unique across the entire React app.

const MyComponent = () => {
  const id = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Name:</label>
      <input id={id} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
};
