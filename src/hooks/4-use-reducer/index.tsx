/*
4. useReducer : useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values 
or when the next state depends on the previous one. 
useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down 
instead of callbacks.

useReducer is related to reducers in Redux, but itâ€™s built into React.
It is used to store complex state logic in a component.
